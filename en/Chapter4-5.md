# 4.5 Test CAN Bus

This example demonstrates the use of the Linux API, which uses the CAN bus interface on the development board to send and receive data. Copy can_send and can_receive to the development board. Perform the following steps

MYD-JA5D2X board has one CAN bus interface(J20), which can communicate with other CAN node device.

Configure the CAN0 bitrate is 50kbps and enable it:

```
canconfig can0 bitrate 50000 ctrlmode triple-sampling on
canconfig can0 start
```

- Board as senderï¼š

```
./can_send -d can0 -i 0x01 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66 &
```

- Board as receiver:

```
./can_receive -d can0
can1 0x1 [6] 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66
can1 0x1 [6] 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66
can1 0x1 [6] 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66
can1 0x1 [6] 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66
can1 0x1 [6] 0x11 0x22 0x33 0x44 0x55 0x66
```
