# 4 Linux Application Development

This chapter introduces the use of the MYD-JA5D2X development board peripheral hardware device application examples.

Before use, you need to compile all the routine code, and copy to the development board directory.

```
cd $DEV_ROOT/04-Sources
tar xvf example.tar.bz2
cd example
make
```
